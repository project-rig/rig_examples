Rig Usage Examples
==================

A library of example programs which demonstrate basic usage of the Rig library.
Very much a work-in-progress...

Each subdirectory of this repository contains its own self-contained example
program along with a readme which walks through the key parts of the example.
This documentation is designed to be compiled by Sphinx and the latest version
can be found on [Read the
Docs](http://rig-examples.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). New users are encouraged
to work their way through the numbered examples in order for a more coherent
and gradual introduction to Rig.
